        "*K-means* is a classic example of *unsupervised learning*: there is no target that we are trying to predict.  Instead we are trying to extract a hidden structure.  The goal of *k-means* is to find $k$ clusters, or groups, within a dataset.  Each cluster is represented by a point $m$, and the data points that are closest to that point are assigned to the corresponding cluster.  The *means* aspect of the algorithm comes from how these cluster representations are calculated: by computing the mean of the points currently assigned to that cluster.  For more details, read Section *7.3* of Alpaydin. Below I give pseudo-code for the algorithm:\n",
